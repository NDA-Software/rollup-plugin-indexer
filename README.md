# Rollup Plugin Indexer

## Description

This package was made as a way to streamline my own bundling adding the function "indexer" from the package "ts-cornucopia" as part of the rollup's execution instead of being run manually.

After this plugin is executed, any folder selected for its execution should have an index file which imports and exports all other files inside same folder (including other folders), this is always recursive.
